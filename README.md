# Operating-System-Projects

All these labs were done using C.

### Lab 1
This lab comprises implementations of the following Linux commands using C:

ls: Lists the contents of a directory


env: Extracts specified environment variable settings from a file


wc: Simulates the wc command, counting lines, words, and bytes in a file


This lab involved practical examples of system calls, file manipulation, and command-line argument handling in C programming.

### Lab 2
Built a Mini Shell (MSH), a simple Unix-like shell implemented in C. It provides basic shell functionalities, including command execution, background execution, input/output redirection, and support for built-in commands such as "mytime" and "mycalc."

### Lab 3
Developed a multi-threaded implementation of a banking system, featuring producer (ATM) and consumer (worker) threads. The system reads banking operations from a file, enqueues them in a circular queue, and concurrently performs operations on bank accounts using multiple threads.
